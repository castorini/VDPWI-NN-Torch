:::::::::::: SICK (Sentences Involving Compositional Knowledge) data set ::::::::::::


The SICK data set consists of 10,000 English sentence pairs, built starting from two existing 
paraphrase sets: the 8K ImageFlickr data set (http://nlp.cs.illinois.edu/HockenmaierGroup/data.html) 
and the SEMEVAL-2012 Semantic Textual Similarity Video Descriptions data set 
(http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2012/task6/index.php?id=data). Each sentence pair is annotated 
for relatedness in meaning and for the entailment relation between the two elements.
